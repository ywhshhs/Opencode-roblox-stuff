/**
 * Minimal Mode Example - Demonstrates a "minimal" tool display mode
 *
 * This extension overrides built-in tools to provide custom rendering:
 * - Collapsed mode: Only shows the tool call (command/path), no output
 * - Expanded mode: Shows full output like the built-in renderers
 *
 * This demonstrates how a "minimal mode" could work, where ctrl+o cycles through:
 * - Standard: Shows truncated output (current default)
 * - Expanded: Shows full output (current expanded)
 * - Minimal: Shows only tool call, no output (this extension's collapsed mode)
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pi -e ./minimal-mode.ts
 *
 * Then use ctrl+o to toggle between minimal (collapsed) and full (expanded) views.
