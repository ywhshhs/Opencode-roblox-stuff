/**
 * Preset Extension
 *
 * Allows defining named presets that configure model, thinking level, tools,
 * and system prompt instructions. Presets are defined in JSON config files
 * and can be activated via CLI flag, /preset command, or Ctrl+Shift+U to cycle.
 *
 * Config files (merged, project takes precedence):
 * - ~/.nyan/agent/presets.json (global)
 * - <cwd>/.nyan/presets.json (project-local)
 *
 * Example presets.json:
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "plan": {
 *     "provider": "openai-codex",
 *     "model": "gpt-5.2-codex",
 *     "thinkingLevel": "high",
 *     "tools": ["read", "grep", "find", "ls"],
 *     "instructions": "You are in PLANNING MODE. Your job is to deeply understand the problem and create a detailed implementation plan.\n\nRules:\n- DO NOT make any changes. You cannot edit or write files.\n- Read files IN FULL (no offset/limit) to get complete context. Partial reads miss critical details.\n- Explore thoroughly: grep for related code, find similar patterns, understand the architecture.\n- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are ambiguous. Do not assume.\n- Identify risks, edge cases, and dependencies before proposing solutions.\n\nOutput:\n- Create a structured plan with numbered steps.\n- For each step: what to change, why, and potential risks.\n- List files that will be modified.\n- Note any tests that should be added or updated.\n\nWhen done, ask the user if they want you to:\n1. Write the plan to a markdown file (e.g., PLAN.md)\n2. Create a GitHub issue with the plan\n3. Proceed to implementation (they should switch to 'implement' preset)"
 *   },
 *   "implement": {
 *     "provider": "anthropic",
 *     "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
 *     "thinkingLevel": "high",
 *     "tools": ["read", "bash", "edit", "write"],
 *     "instructions": "You are in IMPLEMENTATION MODE. Your job is to make focused, correct changes.\n\nRules:\n- Keep scope tight. Do exactly what was asked, no more.\n- Read files before editing to understand current state.\n- Make surgical edits. Prefer edit over write for existing files.\n- Explain your reasoning briefly before each change.\n- Run tests or type checks after changes if the project has them (npm test, npm run check, etc.).\n- If you encounter unexpected complexity, STOP and explain the issue rather than hacking around it.\n\nIf no plan exists:\n- Ask clarifying questions before starting.\n- Propose what you'll do and get confirmation for non-trivial changes.\n\nAfter completing changes:\n- Summarize what was done.\n- Note any follow-up work or tests that should be added."
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Usage:
 * - `pi --preset plan` - start with plan preset
 * - `/preset` - show selector to switch presets mid-session
 * - `/preset implement` - switch to implement preset directly
 * - `Ctrl+Shift+U` - cycle through presets
 *
 * CLI flags always override preset values.
